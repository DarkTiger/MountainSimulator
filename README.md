# Mountain Simulator
Mountain Simulator is a project that I developed in 2015, developed with Unity Engine, where the player walk and explore a vaste mountainous level. The idea of this project was to recreate graphically an area like Trentino (Italy) to experiment with development of large levels with Unity Engine with realistic graphic.
